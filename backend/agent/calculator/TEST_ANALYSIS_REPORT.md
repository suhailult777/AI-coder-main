   test('HTML structure is correct', () => {
       const display = document.getElementById('display');
       const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');
       expect(display).not.toBeNull();
       expect(buttons.length).toBe(19);
   });
   ```

2. **Responsiveness Test**: Verify that the calculator is responsive on different screen sizes.
   ```javascript
   test('Calculator is responsive', () => {
       // Simulate different screen sizes and verify layout
       // This would typically be done using a tool like Jest with a library like jest-environment-jsdom
   });
   ```

3. **Functionality Test**: Verify that the calculator performs basic arithmetic operations correctly.
   ```javascript
   test('Calculator performs basic arithmetic operations', () => {

        currentInput = "1+2";
        display.value = "1+2";
        buttons[3].addEventListener("click", () => {
            try {
                currentInput = eval(currentInput);
                display.value = currentInput;
            } catch (error) {
                display.value = "Error";
                currentInput = "";
            }
        });
        expect(display.value).toBe("3");
        expect(currentInput).toBe(3);
    });

    test("should handle invalid input", () => {
        currentInput = "1++2";
        display.value = "1++2";
        buttons[3].addEventListener("click", () => {
            try {
                currentInput = eval(currentInput);
                display.value = currentInput;
            } catch (error) {
                display.value = "Error";
                currentInput = "";
            }
        });
        expect(display.value).toBe("Error");
        expect(currentInput).toBe("");
    });
});
```
