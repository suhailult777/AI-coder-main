# Agent Mode Integration - Complete âœ…

## Summary

The `my-cursor - agent mode` worker process has been successfully integrated into the AI-coder-main project. The integration is now ready for deployment to Vercel.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Agent Integration**

- âœ… Created `AI-coder-main/agent/` directory
- âœ… Moved agent worker process from `my-cursor - agent mode/index.js` to `AI-coder-main/agent/index.js`
- âœ… Updated environment configuration to load `.env` from parent directory
- âœ… Verified all dependencies are present in package.json

### 2. **Server Updates**

- âœ… Updated `server/index.js` to point to integrated agent path: `path.join(__dirname, '..', 'agent')`
- âœ… Updated agent status endpoint to use new path
- âœ… Verified all API endpoints work correctly

### 3. **Environment Configuration**

- âœ… Confirmed `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present in `.env` file
- âœ… Agent now loads environment variables from parent directory
- âœ… All dependencies installed via pnpm

### 4. **Testing**

- âœ… Server starts successfully on http://localhost:3000
- âœ… Agent process can be spawned correctly
- âœ… Agent can execute commands and create files
- âœ… VSCode integration works
- âœ… Status polling works correctly

### 5. **Cleanup**

- âœ… Removed old `my-cursor - agent mode` folder
- âœ… Integration is now self-contained within AI-coder-main

## File Structure (After Integration)

```
AI-coder-main/
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js          # Integrated agent worker process
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js          # Updated to use integrated agent
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Contains all required dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                  # Contains GEMINI_API_KEY
â””â”€â”€ ... (other files)
```

## Key Dependencies

The following dependencies are already installed in package.json:

- `@google/generative-ai`: ^0.24.1 (for Gemini AI)
- `express`: ^4.18.2
- `dotenv`: ^16.3.1

## Deployment Ready

The project is now ready for Vercel deployment:

1. **Single Repository**: Everything is contained in AI-coder-main
2. **Environment Variables**: All required env vars are in `.env`
3. **Dependencies**: All dependencies are in package.json
4. **Tested Integration**: Agent mode works correctly through the web interface

## How Agent Mode Works

1. User authenticates and toggles Agent Mode in the web interface
2. User submits a complex coding request
3. Server spawns agent process: `spawn('node', ['index.js'], { cwd: agentPath })`
4. Agent receives prompt via `USER_PROMPT` environment variable
5. Agent uses Gemini AI to process request and execute commands
6. Agent creates files/projects and opens them in VSCode
7. Status updates are provided via JSON file polling

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start the server
pnpm start

# Test agent directly (optional)
cd agent
$env:USER_PROMPT="Create a simple HTML page"
node index.js
```

## Vercel Deployment

The project is now ready for Vercel deployment. Make sure to:

1. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `SESSION_SECRET`
   - Other required env vars

2. Deploy the entire AI-coder-main folder

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

The agent mode integration is complete and the old `my-cursor - agent mode` folder has been removed. The project is now unified and ready for production deployment.
