- [ ] Take screenshots of working application
- [ ] Note current domain/URL

### ‚úÖ Account Setup
- [ ] Create Netlify account
- [ ] Create Render account  
- [ ] Verify GitHub repository access
- [ ] Prepare API keys and credentials

## üîß Code Modifications Completed

### ‚úÖ Backend Configuration
- [x] Updated CORS settings for cross-origin requests
- [x] Added production environment variable handling
- [x] Enhanced logging for debugging
- [x] Maintained all existing functionality (auth, agent mode, SSE)

### ‚úÖ Frontend Configuration  
- [x] Created configuration system for API endpoints
- [x] Updated all fetch calls to use configuration
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility for local development
- [x] Added production configuration file

### ‚úÖ Deployment Configuration
- [x] Created `render.yaml` for backend deployment
- [x] Created `netlify.toml` for frontend deployment and API proxying
- [x] Added environment variable templates
- [x] Created deployment scripts

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backend Deployment (Render)
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL database on Render
- [ ] Deploy backend service to Render
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
  - [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` (new secure value)
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (from Render database)
  - [ ] `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - [ ] `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  - [ ] `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
  - [ ] `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
  - [ ] `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` (will be Netlify URL)
- [ ] Verify backend deployment successful
- [ ] Test `/api/health` endpoint

### Step 2: Frontend Configuration
- [ ] Update `public/config.js` with Render backend URL
- [ ] Verify all API calls use configuration system
- [ ] Test local development still works

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment (Netlify)
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Netlify
- [ ] Configure build settings (publish directory: `public`)
- [ ] Verify API proxy rules working
- [ ] Test frontend loads correctly

### Step 4: Cross-Platform Integration
- [ ] Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Render with actual Netlify URL
- [ ] Test authentication works across domains
- [ ] Verify SSE streaming works
- [ ] Test agent mode functionality
